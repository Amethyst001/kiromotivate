Project: KiroMotivate 🎃
Purpose: Demonstrate Kiro vibe-coding for generating short textual outputs with a Halloween theme.

Features Implemented:
1. Daily Motivation Generator - generates short, uplifting sentences.
2. Idea Name Generator - generates spooky product/idea names; includes a random name option if input is empty.
3. Halloween Theme - dark backgrounds, glowing/flickering text, ghostly animations, orange/neon green accents.
4. Dice Button - instant random name generation.

How Kiro Was Used:

Vibe Coding:
- The project was created entirely using Kiro’s chat-based vibe coding.
- Prompts described the UI, features, and visual style.
- Kiro generated the HTML, CSS, and JS step by step based on these prompts.
- Subsequent prompts refined animations, emoji usage, and random name functionality.

Agent Hooks / Steering / MCP:
- Not used in this project; full functionality achieved through guided prompts and Kiro’s code generation.

Halloween UI:
- Prompts instructed Kiro to apply a dark, spooky theme with glowing/flickering effects and ghostly animations.
- Kiro suggested color palette, hover effects, and smooth animations.

Usage Notes:
- To generate content, Kiro uses the prompts in this file to simulate API responses.
- Developers can replace simulated responses with live Kiro API calls by connecting the prompt instructions to Kiro’s endpoints.
